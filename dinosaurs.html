<tr> <td>Deinonychus</td> <td>Theropod</td> <td>Early Cretaceous</td> <td>Up to 3.4 meters (11ft 2in) long</td> <td>Carnivore</td> <td>1931 by Barnum Brown in Montana</td> <td>It had a large sickle claw on second toe of each foot</td> <td>The velociraptors in 'Jurassic Park' and 'Jurassic World' are actually deinonychus in all but name due to a naming mixup in possible source material</tr>
<tr> <td>Tyrannosaurus Rex</td> <td>Theropod</td> <td>Late Cretaceous</td> <td> Over 12.3 meters (40ft) long </td> <td>Carnivore</td> <td>1902 by Barnum Brown in Wyoming</td> <td>It had tiny but deceptively strong forelimbs</td> <td>T-Rex had the most powerful bite of any land animal that has ever lived and despite their size had powerful arms capable up lifting itself up from lying down</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Triceratops</td> <td>Ceratopsid</td> <td>Late Cretaceous</td> <td>Between 7.9-9.0 meters (25.9-29.5ft) long</td> <td>Herbivore</td> <td>1887 in Colorado</td> <td>It had two 1 meter (3.3ft) long horns above each eye and a horn above the nose</td> <td>Triceratops was first thought to be an overgrown bison and its skull takes up 1/3 of its body</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Stegosaurus</td> <td>Thyreophoran</td> <td>Late Jurassic</td> <td>Up to 9 meters (29.5ft) long</td> <td>Herbivore</td> <td>1877 by Othniel Charels Marsh in Colorado</td> <td>It had two rows of large armored plates along its back and large spikes on its tail</td> <td>Its brain, once thought to reside in its butt due to its small head, was the size of a walnut</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Brachiosaurus</td> <td>Sauropod</td> <td>Late Jurassic</td> <td>Between 18-21 meters (59-69ft) long</td> <td>Herbivore</td> <td>1900 by Elmer S. Riggs in Colorado</td> <td>It had exceptionally long neck ,legs, and tail even for a sauropod.</td> <td>It was the first computer generated dinosaur in 'Jurassic Park' and was considered ground-breaking at the time and is still considered breath-taking to this day</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Spinosaurus</td> <td>Theropod</td> <td>Early-Late Cretaceous</td> <td>Between 15-15.6 meters (49-51ft) long</td> <td>Carnivore</td> <td>1912 by Richard Markgraf in Egypt</td> <td>It had a large dorsal sail or hump along its back</td> <td>In 'Jurassic Park III' it is depicted as being capable of defeating a T-Rex, however, recent science has proven that inaccurate</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Carnotaurus</td> <td>Theropod</td> <td>Late Cretaceous</td> <td>Between 7.5-9 meters (24.6-29.5ft) long</td> <td>Carnivore</td> <td>1984 by Jose Bonaparte in Argentina</td> <td>It was the only bipedal carnivore that had two horns on the top of the frontal bone</td> <td>It had the tinest forearms of any other dinosaur, was an almost complete skeleton when found, and had fossilized skin impressions </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Dilophosaurus</td> <td>Theropod</td> <td>Early Jurassic</td> <td>Up to 7 meters (23ft) long</td> <td>Carnivore</td> <td>1942 by Charles L. Camp in Arizona</td> <td>It had two high, thin, and arched crests on its skull.</td> <td>Contrary to its portrayal in 'Jurassic Park' Dilophosaurus neither spat poison nor had a colorful frill and was much bigger, it was the movie's only serious departure from scientific accuracy </td> </tr>
